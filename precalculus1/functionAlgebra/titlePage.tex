We have \textbf{operations} for our numbers.  Operations usually take two numbers and exchange them for a third numbmer.



Just like numbers, functions have an arithmetic.  They have all of the usual number operations, plus one more.  Functions also have composition as an operation.

Just like number operations have an identiy number, $0$ and $1$, composition has an identiy function - the identity function: $I(x) = x$.


\begin{itemize}
\item Adding $0$ with numbers appears to do nothing.
\item Multiplying $1$ with numbers appears to do nothing.
\item Composing the identity function with functions appears to do nothing.
\end{itemize}
