The formula template for the basic exponential function looks like




\[  a \, r^x   \, \text{ with } \,  a, r \in \mathbb{R} \, | \,  r > 0   \]


As we have seen before, the coefficient $a$ controls vertical stretching or compression. The sign of $a$ dictates the sign of our function values. $r$ dictates a growing or decaying function.


Shifted exponential functions shift the range by adding a constant. \\


\[  a \, r^x  + b \, \text{ with } \,  a, b, r \in \mathbb{R} \, | \,  r > 0   \]




These no longer have a constant percent growth rate.  However, their analysis is exactly the same as for exponential functions with one big difference in our conclusions. Shifted exponential functions may have zeros. \\
