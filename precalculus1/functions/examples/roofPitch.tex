The pitch of a roof is its vertical ``rise'' over its horizontal ``span''. However, most often a ratio of ``pitch'' (also fraction) is slang used for the (more useful) ``slope'' (of rise over 'run') of just one side (half the span) of a dual pitched roof. This is the ``slope'' of geometry, stairways and other construction disciplines, or the trigonometric arc tangent function of its decimal fraction. In the imperial measurement systems, ``pitch'' is usually expressed with the rise first and run second. - Wikipedia


\begin{example} Pitch


Expressed as a fraction the pitch of a roof would look like

\[
\frac{rise}{span} = \frac{5 ft}{6 ft} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

If the units are the same, then they can be dropped, otherwise, the pitch requires the units.
\end{example}






\begin{example} More Common Pitch (Slope)


Expressed as a fraction the pitch of a roof would look like

\[
\frac{rise}{run} = \frac{rise}{tfrac{span}{2}} = \frac{5 ft}{3 ft} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

If the units are the same, then they can be dropped, otherwise, the pitch requires the units.
\end{example}

We'll use the more common pitch as $\frac{rise}{run}$, e.g. $run = \frac{1}{2} span$. And, our measurements will always be in feet.  Therefore, we will only need numbers in our domain and codomain.



\subsection*{Pitch}
We can create the \textbf{Pitch} relation between the rise and run (half-span).  The domain and range are both length measurements.  An ordered pair $(rise, run)$ would represent a pitch.








\begin{question}

Suppose a roof with a span of $20 ft$ has a pitch of $\frac{2}{5}$.  

The \textit{run} of the roof is $\answer{10} ft$.

The \textit{rise} of the roof is $\answer{4} ft$.

In the \textit{Pitch} relation, this pitch would be represented as $\left( 2, \answer{5} \right)$.

\end{question}











\begin{question}

Suppose a roof with a rise of $8 ft$ has a pitch of $\frac{2}{3}$.  

The \textit{run} of the roof is $\answer{12} ft$.

The \textit{span} of the roof is $\answer{24} ft$.

In the \textit{Pitch} relation, this pitch would be represented as $\left( 2, \answer{3} \right)$.

\end{question}

Let's define a new pitch relation called \textit{HalfPitch}.  All pitches in this relation equal $\frac{1}{2}$.  (The rise and the run are still always measured in feet.)




\begin{question}

Suppose a roof has a rise of $8 ft$.  

Then the run is $\answer{16} ft$ and the span is $\answer{32} ft$.

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{8}{\answer{16}}
\]


In the \textit{HalfPitch} relation, this pitch would be represented as $\left( 8, \answer{16} \right)$.

\end{question}








\begin{question}

Suppose a roof has a span of $8 ft$.  

Then the run is $\answer{4} ft$ and the rise is $\answer{2} ft$.

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\answer{2}}{4}
\]


In the \textit{HalfPitch} relation, this pitch would be represented as $\left( \answer{2}, 4 \right)$.

\end{question}







\begin{exercise}  Function?
