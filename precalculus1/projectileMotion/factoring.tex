\subsection*{Elementary Functions}

We have two types of elementary functions, so far:

\begin{itemize}
\item Linear functions
\item Quadratic functions
\end{itemize}

One of our goals for analysis is to identify zeros of functions. \\

Unless the linear function is actually a constant function (which is a linear function), the linear function has exactly one zero. We can identify this unique zero by setting the formula equal to $0$ and solving.  This is accomplished by combining like terms and isolating the variable on one side of the equation.

We have seen two approaches to identifying zeros of quadratic functions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Completing the Square
\item {The Quadratic Formula}
\end{itemize}

We touched on a third approach, factoring. \\

It turns out that the quadratic formula can help our factoring quite a bit. \\









We have seen that there are at most two real solutions to $a \, t^2 + b \, t + c = 0$, with $a \ne 0$. 

Let's look at this from a function viewpoint.  The quadratic function  $Q(t) = a \, t^2 + b \, t + c$ has at most two real zeros.  

The quadratic formula gives explicit expressions for these roots.


\[   \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a}     \text{ and }    \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a}   \]





$\blacktriangleright$  Are there other quadratic equations, besides $a \, t^2 + b \, t + c = 0$, that have these two solutions?















Perhaps, there are other quadratic functions, which have these two zeros. Let's create a quadratic function from these two zeros.



\[ f(t) =  \left(t - \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a}\right)   \left(t -  \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a}\right)   \]


If we multiply this out, we get



\[ f(t) =   t^2 \, - \, \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a} t \, - \, \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a}  t \, + \, \left(\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a}\right) \left(\frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a}\right) \]


\[ f(t) = t^2  \, - \, 2 \cdot \frac{-b}{2a} + \left(    \frac{b^2 - (b^2 - 4 a c)}{4 a^2}     \right)        \]


\[ f(t) = t^2  \, + \frac{b}{a} + \left(    \frac{4 a c}{4 a^2}     \right)        \]

\[ f(t) = t^2  \, +  \frac{b}{a} + \left(    \frac{c}{a}     \right)        \]


This quadratic function has the same two zeros as $Q(t)$.  


\textbf{Note:} If we multiply this by $a$, we get 


\[ a \, f(t) = a \, t^2 + b \, t + c \]

which is $Q(t)$.


$\blacktriangleright$ If two quadratics have the same two roots, then they must be multiples of each other.






We have discovered a new expression or formula or form for our quadratic functions.





\[ f(t) =  \left(t - \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a}\right)   \left(t -  \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a}\right)   \]







\subsection*{Factored Form}

\textbf{\textcolor{red!90!darkgray}{$\blacktriangleright$ Standard Form}} Every quadratic function can be written as a sum, $Q(t) = a \, t^2 + b \, t + c$, with $a \ne 0$. \\



\textbf{\textcolor{red!90!darkgray}{$\blacktriangleright$ Vertex Form}} Every quadratic function can be written with one occurrence of the variable via a square, $Q(t) = a \, (t - h)^2 + k$, with $a \ne 0$. \\



\textbf{\textcolor{red!90!darkgray}{$\blacktriangleright$ Factored Form}} Every quadratic function can be written as a product, $Q(t) = a \, (t - r_1)(t - r_2)$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the real zeros and $a \ne 0$ - provided the quadratic function has two real zeros. \\





The real zeros can be obtained via the quadratic formula - provided the discrimanant is positve.  If the discriminant is $0$, then $r_1 = r_2$ and we get a square.  If the discriminant is negative, then $Q(t)$ doesn't factor with real numbers.  


The process of writing the function as a product is called \textbf{factoring}. $(t - r_1)$  and $(t - r_2)$ are the \textbf{factors}.



\begin{example} \textit{Two Real Solutions} 

Factor $Q(t) = 4 \, t^2 - 4 \, t - 8$ 

\begin{explanation}

The leading coefficient is $a=4$ and the quadratic formula gives us $2$ and $-1$ as zeros.  

That gives us a \textbf{factorization} of $Q(t)$:



\[    Q(t) = 4 \, t^2 - 4 \, t - 8 =  4 (t-2)(t-(-1))    = 4 (t-2)(t+1)         \]

\end{explanation}

\end{example}



The quadratic formula always works.  But, many times it is slow with lots of steps and reducing.  Sometimes it is just easier to guess the factors.  ``Easier'' usually means integers.




















\subsection*{Guessing Factors}


Let's begin with a quadratic function written as a sum: $g(x) = a \, x^2 + b \, x + c$, a.k.a \textbf{standard form}.  


\textbf{\textcolor{blue!75!black}{Step 1:}} If there are any common numeric factors among the three coefficients then factor them out.


\textbf{\textcolor{blue!75!black}{Step 2:}} We are looking for a factorization $g(x) = a \, x^2 + b \, x + c = (A \, x + B)(C \, x + D)$.

for this to happen, we need

\begin{itemize}
\item $a = A \cdot C $
\item $b = A\cdot D + B \cdot C$
\item $c = B \cdot D$
\end{itemize}

Therefore, look for pairs of factors of $a$ and pairs of factors of $c$.






\textbf{\textcolor{blue!75!black}{Step 3:}} Step through your pairs of factors and look for $b = A \cdot D + B \cdot C$.










\begin{example} \textit{Factoring}

Factor $k(x) = 2 \, x^2 - 5 \, x - 12$.


\begin{explanation}

First, the coefficients, $2$, $-5$, and $-21$, have no common factors.


Second, $2$ is a prime number, therefore, it's factors are $2 \cdot 1$ or $-2 \cdot -1$.

From this, we know there are only two possibilities. The factorization looks like $(2 x \, + \, ?) (x \, + \, ?)$ or $(-2 x \, + \, ?) (-x \, + \, ?)$.






$-12$ factors as 
\begin{itemize}
\item $-12 \cdot \answer{1}$
\item $12 \cdot \answer{-1}$
\item $-6 \cdot \answer{2}$
\item $6 \cdot \answer{-2}$
\item $-4 \cdot \answer{3}$
\item $4 \cdot \answer{-3}$  
\end{itemize}



Let's start stepping through our list.

The middle term is $-5 \, x$.  That's our goal. It seems like it might be difficult to get $5$ from $12$, let's skip $12$ in our list and begin stepping through our list with $-6$ and $2$.

\begin{itemize}

\item $-12 = -6 \cdot 2$ gives $(2 x + (-6)) (x + 2) = \answer{2 x^2 - 2 x - 12}$
\item $-12 = 6 \cdot -2$ gives $(2 x + 6) (x - 2) = \answer{2 x^2 + 2 x -12}$
\item $-12 = -3 \cdot 4$ gives $(2 x + (-3)) (x + 4) = \answer{2 x^2 + 5 x - 12}$
\item $-12 = 3 \cdot -4$ gives $(2 x + 3) (x + (-4)) = \answer{2 x^2 - 5 x -12}$
\end{itemize}

$2 x^2 - 5 x - 12$ factors as $(2 x + 3) (x + (-4)) = (2 x + 3)(x - 4)$


\end{explanation}
\end{example}

As you gain more experience, this process becomes a mental process, which means it is fast. \\


Always give factoring a try, before moving onto the quadratic formula. \\






\begin{example} \textit{Factoring}

Factor $p(y) = 6 \, y^2 - 16 \, y - 22$.

\begin{explanation}

First, the coefficients have a common factor.  Factor out $2$ to get $p(y) = 2 \left( \answer{3 y^2 - 8 y - 11} \right)$.


Now factor $3 \, y^2 - 8 \, y - 11$.



$3$ is a prime number, therefore, it's factors are $3 \cdot 1$ or $-3 \cdot -1$. However, $-3 \cdot -1$ is actually redundant.  If we picked $-3 \cdot -1$, then we could just factor out $-1$ from both and get back to $3 \cdot 1$.


$3 \, y^2 - 8 \, y - 11 = (3y \, \pm \, ?) (y \, \pm \, ?) $


$11$ is also a prime number. We only need to think about $11$ and $1$. And, since we need $-11$, then we know to pick opposite signs for $11$ and $1$.



\begin{itemize}
\item $(3y + 11) (y - 1) = \answer{3 y^2 + 8 y - 11}$
\end{itemize}

Everything is correct except the sign of $-8$. That tells us we are almost correct. We just need to reverse the signs.


\begin{itemize}
\item $(3y - 11) (y + 1) = 3 \, y^2 - 8 \, y - 11$
\end{itemize}




\end{explanation}
\end{example}


``Easier'' usually means integers.  

All of the factorizations above involved integers, because we are fast with those. \\



If the roots of the quadratic involve square roots, then we probably are not guessing them.  In any case, the quadratic formula will find all of the roots.
