We have two different viewpoints when examining functions.


$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Numbers:}  Functions consist of individual pairs of individual numbers.  When we \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{evaluate}} functions, we think of each pair one at a time.  The graphs of functions are individual dots plotted to represent points, which visually encode the function pairs. 







$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Intervals:} As we compare function values, we notice patterns, which we call \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{behavior}}. We naturally group many pairs together where the function has similar behavior.  Collecting such pairs forms domain intervals and we begin thinking in terms of intervals.





In particular, we calculate \textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{rate of change}} over intervals, which measures behavior. 



The rate of change of the function $f$ over the interval $[a, b]$ is given by $\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$.




However, intervals are just collections of individual numbers.  Is there a way to translate this ``rate of change'' idea down to individual numbers?

The answer is yes.  \\


We will begin this thought experiment here with quadratic functions. We'll extend this thought a bit throughout the course. Then Calculus will answer the question fully with the derivative.
