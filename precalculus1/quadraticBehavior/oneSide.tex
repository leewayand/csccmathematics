Tangent lines are lines that are tangent to a curve or graph at a tangent point. There must be a point on the curve. At that tangent point, the curve or graph is behaving in some manner, which the tangent line is modeling.  \\

\begin{idea} \textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Tangent}}

A tangent line is a line that does the best job of pretending to be the curve at a single point.
\end{idea}
\textbf{Best job} means the line shares the tangent point with the curve and the slope of the line is the same as the ``slope'' of the curve at the tangent point. \\





This is possible even at an endpoint on a graph.

This point $(4, -3)$ is an endpoint on the graph, in which case there might be a line that models one side of the graph. \\

A tangent line, well, a one-sided tangent line. \\

We have a tangent line.  It is a one-sided tangent line. \\




Secant lines on the left approach the tangent line.

The secant lines on the left smoothly turn into the tangent line as you move to the right. \\


There are no secant lines on the right, so we don't have to worry about them. \\





In this case, we have a one-side tangent line.  \\

We have a one-side derivative. \\


For the function above, we have a \textbf{left derivative}.












Similarly, we might have a one-side tangent line on the right.  \\

We would have a one-side derivative. \\


We would have a \textbf{right derivative}.









\begin{definition} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Derivative}}  (two-sided)


Suppose we have a really nice situation.


\begin{itemize}
\item We have a function, $f$, 
\item We have and a domain number, $t$, 
\item This domain number is inside an open interval inside the domain.  $t \in (a, b) \subset Domain$. 
\item The tangent lines on both sides of $(t, f(t))$ are smootlhy approach the same line from both sides.
\end{itemize}

Then, there is a tangent line to the graph of $f$ and the tangent lines on both sides are smootly turning into this tangent line at the tangent point $(t, f(t))$. \\

The slope of this tangent line is the value of the \textbf{derivative} of $f$ at $t$.

\[
iRoC(t) =f'(t) = \text{slope of tangent line}
\]


On the other hand, if the tangent lines and both sides are not smoothly agreeing, then there is no tangent line at $(t, f(t))$ and the derivative does not exist at $t$.   

\end{definition}

\textbf{Note}:The term `derivative" implies a two-sided derivative.  Otherwise, we would say `right' or `left'. \\




\begin{idea}

For the derivative to exist at a domain number, the corresponding point on the graph must have secants approaching on both sides. \\




\end{idea}







\begin{idea}

This means that end-point numbers for domain intervals are automatically critical numbers.  The derivative cannot exist at end-points, even if there is a one-sided tangent line. \\

\end{idea}













\begin{definition} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Left Derivative}}  (one-sided) 


Suppose we have a really nice situation.


\begin{itemize}
\item We have a function, $f$, 
\item We have and a domain number, $t$, 
\item This domain number is inside an  interval inside the domain of the form  $t \in (a, t] \subset Domain$. 
\item The tangent lines on the left side of $(t, f(t))$ are smootlhy approach the same line.
\end{itemize}

Then, there is a tangent line to the graph of $f$ and the tangent lines on the left side are smootly turning into this tangent line at the tangent point $(t, f(t))$. \\

The slope of this tangent line is the value of the \textbf{left derivative of $f$ at $t$}.

\[
iRoC_{f_{-}}(t) =f'_{-}(t) = \text{slope of tangent line}
\]


 

\end{definition}
The left derivative is symbolized with a subscript of ``-'' with the derivative name. \\





\begin{definition} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Right Derivative}}  (one-sided) 


Suppose we have a really nice situation.


\begin{itemize}
\item We have a function, $f$, 
\item We have and a domain number, $t$, 
\item This domain number is inside an  interval inside the domain of the form  $t \in [t, b) \subset Domain$. 
\item The tangent lines on the right side of $(t, f(t))$ are smootlhy approach the same line.
\end{itemize}

Then, there is a tangent line to the graph of $f$ and the tangent lines on the right side are smootly turning into this tangent line at the tangent point $(t, f(t))$. \\

The slope of this tangent line is the value of the \textbf{right derivative of $f$ at $t$}.

\[
iRoC_{f_{+}}(t) =f'_{+}(t) = \text{slope of tangent line}
\]


 

\end{definition}

The right derivative is symbolized with a subscript of ``+'' with the derivative name. \\







\section*{No Side}


If the domain number is isolated, meaning no domain numbers immediately to the left or right, then there just is no derivative there. \\

The term derivative implies thatthere is some sort of approaching.
