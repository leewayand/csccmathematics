The equation relating two functions tells us the algebraic transformations for the domain and range. \\

We just need to read it correctly. \\



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$}}  Suppose we have a function $H$ with the set $[-5, 1) \cup (7, 11]$ as its domain and the set $(-3, 9]$ as its range. \\

Let's use $d$ to represent domain values of $H$.  That means $d$ represents the numbers $[-5, 1) \cup (7, 11]$. \\

Then, the symbol $H(d)$ represents the numbers $(-3, 9]$, \\


\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$}} Now let's introduce a second function called $P$, which is related to $H$. \\

Let's choose $k$ to represent the domain values of $P$. \\


\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$}} Let's suppose that $P$ and $H$ are related by the equation 

\[ 
P(k) = 4 H(k-1) - 2
\]



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{What can we say about $P$?}}  \\



\subsection*{Domain}


We would like to collect information about the domain of $P$. \\

We know that $P(k) = 4 H(k-1) - 2$.

$k$ is representing the domain values of $P$.  If we can figure out what values $k$ can have, then we would know what values are in the domain of $P$. \\

So, what do we know about $k$? \\


We know that $k-1$ represents domain values of $H$.  We know this because the equation uses the notation $H(k-1)$.  The expression inside the parentheses represents the domain values of $H$.  That's what function notation means. \\


That means $k-1$ represents the values  $[-5, 1) \cup (7, 11]$.


\[
k - 1 \in [-5, 1) \cup (7, 11]
\]


\[
k \in [-4, 2) \cup (8, 12]
\]



We now know the values that $k$ can represent, which means we know the domain of $P$. \\












\subsection*{Range}


We would like to collect information about the range of $P$. \\

In other words, we would like to know the function values of $P$. \\ 


We know that $P(k) = 4 H(k-1) - 2$.\\


Or, we know that $P = 4 H - 2$. \\



We know that $H$ represents the values $(-3, 9]$. \\


Then, $4 H$ represents the values $(4 \cdot -3, 4 \cdot 9] = (-12, 36]$ \\



Then, $4 H - 2$ represents the values $(-12 - 2, 36 - 2] = (-14, 34]$ \\


But $P = 4 H - 2$.  Therefore, $P$ represents the values $(-14, 34]$. \\


The range of $P$ is $(-14, 34]$.






\begin{example}




\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$}}  Suppose we have a function $m$ with the set $[-7, 11)$ as its domain and the set $(-12, 8]$ as its range. \\

Let's use $y$ to represent domain values of $m$.  



\begin{question}

That means $y$ represents the numbers 

\[
\left[ \answer{-7}, \answer{11} \right)
\]

\end{question}





\begin{question}

Then, the symbol $m(y)$ represents the numbers

\[
\left( \answer{-12}, \answer{8} \right]
\]

\end{question}




\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$}} Now let's introduce a second function called $W$, which is related to $m$. \\

Let's choose $t$ to represent the domain values of $W$. \\


\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$}} Let's suppose that $W$ and $m$ are related by the equation 

\[ 
W(t) = -2 m(3t + 2) - 5
\]





\begin{question}

In this function equation, what is representing the domain values of $W$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice [correct]{$t$}
\choice {$k$}
\choice {$3k+2$}
\choice {$3t+2$}
\end{multipleChoice}

The expression $3t + 2$ represents what numbers?
