Shifting was the result of adding constants to the argument of a function's formula or to the value of a function.  The shape of the graph remained rigid. The graph just slid to a new position. 



A graph does not remain rigid under the act of \textbf{stretching} or \textbf{compressing}, however, it does maintain its general shape. Multiplication by a constant, either on the domain or range, unevenly stretches or compress the characteristics of a function, but those characteristics still exist.
