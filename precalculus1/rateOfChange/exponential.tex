\textbf{\textcolor{red!70!darkgray}{$\blacktriangleright$ A Peek ahead to Calculus}}





\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{In Calculus}}, we will see all of the rules for obtaining the derivative of any funciton for ourselves. \\

Right now we know three rules:

\begin{itemize}
	\item if $f(x) = a \, x^2 + b \, x + c$, then $f'(x) = 2a \, x + b$
	\item if $f(x) = a \, x + b$, then $f'(x) = a$
	\item if $f(x) = a$, then $f'(x) = 0$
\end{itemize}



When we get to Calculus, we'll be able to ``differentiate'' any function we want. \\

Right now, you would be given the derivative of a function, which you could then use to analyze the function. \\



\begin{example}

When analyzing $f(x) = (3x - 2) e^{4x + 5}$, you might be given the derivative.


\[
f'(x) = 3 \, e^{4x + 5} + (3x - 2) e^{4x + 5} \cdot 4
\]


We could then use this derivative to identify critical numbers and decide where the function $f$ is increasing and decreasing.




\textbf{Critical Numbers} \\


To find critical numbers, we need to solve $f'(x) = 0$. \\


\[
f'(x) = 0
\]


\[
3 \, e^{4x + 5} + (3x - 2) e^{4x + 5} \cdot 4 = 0
\]


\[
e^{4x + 5}  (3 + 4 \, (3x - 2)) = 0
\]


\[
e^{4x + 5}  (12x - 5) = 0
\]



By the zero product property, one of the factors must equal $0$. \\



$\blacktriangleright$ $e^{4x + 5}$ is never $0$, since it is an exponential function. \\


$\blacktriangleright$ $(12x - 5) = 0$, when $x = \frac{5}{12}$. \\



$f$ has $\frac{5}{12}$ as its only critical number. \\




\textbf{Behavior}: Increasing and Decreasing \\



The sign of the derivative will tell us where $f$ is increasing and decreasing. \\


\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$}} Where is $e^{4x + 5}  (12x - 5)$ positive and negative?


This is a product, so we need the signs of the factors. \\


$\blacktriangleright$  $e^{4x + 5}$ is always positive, since it is an exponential function with a positive leading coefficient. \\


$\blacktriangleright$. $(12x - 5)$ is a linear function with a positive leading coefficient, which means the linear function is increasing, which means it is negative to the left and positive to the right of its zero, which is $\frac{5}{12}$. \\



\[
f'(x) < 0 \, \text{ on } \, \left( -\infty, \frac{5}{12} \right)
\]


\[
f'(x) > 0 \, \text{ on } \, \left( \frac{5}{12}, -\infty \right)
\]





\[
f(x)  \, \text{ decreases on } \, \left( -\infty, \frac{5}{12} \right)
\]


\[
f(x)  \, \text{ increases on } \, \left( \frac{5}{12}, -\infty \right)
\]



Since $f(x)$ is continuous, this tells us that there is a local minimum (possibly global) at $\frac{5}{12}$.


\end{example}
