\textbf{\textcolor{red!70!darkgray}{$\blacktriangleright$ A Peek ahead to Calculus}}





\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{In Calculus}}, we will see all of the rules for obtaining the derivative of any funciton for ourselves. \\

Right now we know three rules:

\begin{itemize}
	\item if $f(x) = a \, x^2 + b \, x + c$, then $f'(x) = 2a \, x + b$
	\item if $f(x) = a \, x + b$, then $f'(x) = a$
	\item if $f(x) = a$, then $f'(x) = 0$
\end{itemize}



When we get to Calculus, we'll be able to ``differentiate'' any function we want. \\

Right now, you would be given the derivative of a function, which you could then use to analyze the function. \\



\begin{example}

When analyzing $g(t) = t - \ln(t)$, you might be given the derivative.


\[
g'(t) = 1 + \frac{1}{t} 
\]


We could then use this derivative to identify critical numbers and decide where the function $g$ is increasing and decreasing.




\textbf{Critical Numbers} \\


\textbf{Note:}. The domain of $g$ is $(0, \infty)$. \\



To find critical numbers, we need to solve $g'(t) = 0$. \\


\[
g'(t) = 0
\]


\[
1 - \frac{1}{t}  = 0
\]


\[
1  = \frac{1}{t}
\]





$\blacktriangleright$ $1  = \frac{1}{t}$, when $t = 1$. \\



$g$ has $1$ as its only critical number. \\




\textbf{Behavior}: Increasing and Decreasing \\



The sign of the derivative will tell us where $g$ is increasing and decreasing. \\


\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$}} Where is $1  = \frac{1}{t}$ positive and negative?





\[
g'(t) < 0 \, \text{ on } \, (0, 1)
\]


\[
g'(t) > 0 \, \text{ on } \, (1, \infty)
\]





\[
g(t)  \, \text{ decreases on } \, \left( -\infty, \frac{5}{12} \right)(0, 1)
\]


\[
g(t)  \, \text{ increases on } \, (1, \infty)
\]



Since $g$ is continuous, this tells us that there is a local (possibly global) minimum at $1$.


\end{example}
