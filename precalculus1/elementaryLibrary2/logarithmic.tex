What if we have a function value for an exponential function and we would like to know which domain numbers are associated with it?  In other words, we would like to solve


\[    g(t) = A \cdot r^t  =   g_0    \]


How would we solve for $t$?






\begin{example} If the function value ``works well'', then we could probably guess.

Let $T(f) = 4 \cdot 3^f$.  


Solve $T(f) = 36$

$4 \cdot 3^f = 36$

$3^f = 9$

$f = 2$

\end{example}









Most function values are not going to be so obvious. 


For example, solve $ 3^x = 17$.


We may not be able to quickly think up this number or even an approximation for it.  However, we can still talk about it.

\begin{center}

\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{We are looking for the number that you raise $3$ to, to get $17$.}}

\end{center}


That is a specific number. We can see from the graph that there is only one such number and we could visually approximate it around $2.6$.

  \begin{axis}[
            domain=-10:10, ymax=20, xmax=10, ymin=-10, xmin=-10,

            ticklabel style={font=\scriptsize},
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
            axis on top
          ]
          
          \addplot [line width=1, gray, dashed,domain=(-9:9),<->] ({x},{0});
          \addplot [line width=2, penColor, smooth,samples=200,domain=(-9:2),<->] {3^x};

We can see from the general shape of the graph of an exponential function that any function value is attached to a single unique domain number. \\



\begin{example}
The following are all descriptions that identify unique real numbers.

\begin{itemize}
\item The number that you raise $5$ to, to get $97$.
\item The number that you raise $\frac{3}{4}$ to, to get $6$.
\item The number that you raise $7$ to, to get $\frac{1}{2}$.
\item The number that you raise $101$ to, to get $34$.
\item The number that you raise $10$ to, to get $1,000$.
\end{itemize}

\end{example}



As with all mathematical phrases, we have shorthand notation for these desciptions.








\begin{definition} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Logarithm Base A of B}}

Let $a$ and $b$ be positive real numbers.  The number  you raise $a$ to, to get $b$ is called the \textbf{logarithm base a of b}.

The symbol for the logarithm base a of b is $\log_a(b)$.


$\log_a(b)$ is  the number you raise $a$ to, to get $b$.

\[     a^{\log_a(b)} = b          \]




\end{definition}





\begin{example}
The following are all descriptions that identify unique real numbers.

\begin{itemize}
\item The number that you raise $5$ to, to get $97$ is $\log_5(97)$. \\
\item The number that you raise $\frac{3}{4}$ to, to get $6$ is $\log_{\tfrac{3}{4}}(6)$. \\
\item The number that you raise $7$ to, to get $\frac{1}{2}$ is $\log_7\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$. \\
\item The number that you raise $101$ to, to get $34$ is $\log_{101}(34)$. \\
\item The number that you raise $10$ to, to get $1,000$ is $\log_{10}(1000)$. \\
\end{itemize}

\end{example}



\begin{example}
Evaluate the following expressions

\begin{itemize}
\item  $3^{\log_3{56}} = \answer{56}$
\item  $13^{\log_{13}{21}} = \answer{21}$
\item  $\pi^{\log_{\pi}{82}} = \answer{82}$
\item  $4^{\log_4{\sqrt{7}}} = \answer{\sqrt{7}}$
\item  $85^{\log_{85}{2}} = \answer{2}$

\end{itemize}

\end{example}












Logarithms are exponents.  They can be positive or negative.



$9^{-2} = \frac{1}{81}$, therefore  $\log_{9}\left(\frac{1}{81}\right) = -2$



We also know that raising a positve number to any exponent cannot produce a negative number or $0$.  Therefore, the number \textit{inside} the logarithm must be positive



It sounds like we have a new category of functions.




\begin{definition} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Basic Logarithmic Functions}}

A \textbf{Basic Logarithmic Function} is a function that \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{can}} be represented by formulas of the form

\[     L(x) =    \log_r(x)            \]

where $r > 0$.

The domain is positive real numbers and the range is all real numbers.

\end{definition}












\begin{example}

Here is the graph of $y = L(x) = \log_2(x)$.

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture} 
  \begin{axis}[
            domain=-10:10, ymax=10, xmax=10, ymin=-10, xmin=-10,
            axis lines =center, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
            ytick={-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,2,4,6,8,10},
            xtick={-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,2,4,6,8,10},
            ticklabel style={font=\scriptsize},
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
            axis on top
          ]
          
          \addplot [line width=2, penColor, smooth,samples=200,domain=(0:9),<->] {ln(x)/ln(2)};
          \addplot [line width=1, gray, dashed,domain=(-9:9),<->] ({0},{x});

           

  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}


The intercept is $(1,0)$, because $\log_2(1) = 0$, because $2^0 = 1$.

On the interval $(0,1)$, we are looking at $\log_2(x)$ for $0<x<1$.  Remember, $\log_2(x)$ is the number you raise $2$ to, to get $x$, but here $0<x<1$.  Therefore, $2$ needs a negative exponent or $\log_2(x) < 0$.  And, the smaller (closer to $0$) you want $x$, the bigger the negative exponent.  There is a vertical asymptote. 





\end{example}



If we switch the base from something greater than $1$, to something less than $1$, then all of the exponents flip.  The graph flips.






\begin{example}

Here is the graph of $y = L(x) = \log_{\tfrac{1}{2}}(x)$.

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture} 
  \begin{axis}[
            domain=-10:10, ymax=10, xmax=10, ymin=-10, xmin=-10,
            axis lines =center, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
            ytick={-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,2,4,6,8,10},
            xtick={-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,2,4,6,8,10},
            ticklabel style={font=\scriptsize},
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
            axis on top
          ]
          
          \addplot [line width=2, penColor, smooth,samples=200,domain=(0:9),<->] {ln(x)/ln(0.5)};
          \addplot [line width=1, gray, dashed,domain=(-9:9),<->] ({0},{x});

           

  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}


The intercept is $(1,0)$, because $\log_{\tfrac{1}{2}}(1) = 0$, because $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^0 = 1$.

On the interval $(0,1)$, we are looking at $\log_{\tfrac{1}{2}}(x)$ for $0<x<1$.  Now we just need large positive exponents of $\frac{1}{2}$ to get small numbers.  On the other hand, to get large positive numbers we need to raise $\frac{1}{2}$ to negative powers.





\end{example}











\begin{definition} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Logarithmic Functions}}

A \textbf{Logarithmic Function} is a function that \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{can}} be represented by formulas of the form

\[     L(x) =    A \log_r(B \, x + C) + D            \]

where $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are real numbers and $r > 0$.

The domain is all positive real numbers that make the inside positive.

\end{definition}


\textbf{Note:}  In the template for logarithmic functions, There is a leading coefficient for the function and there is a leading coefficient for the inside linear function. \\
