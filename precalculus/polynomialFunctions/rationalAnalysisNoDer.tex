\subsection*{Complete Analysis}


Completely analyzing a rational completely is impossible without the derivative. 


Let's see what we can get with our algebra and what we cannot.




\[
G(t) = \frac{(t+7)(t+5)(t-2)}{(t+4)^2(t-2)}
\]



\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{Domain}} 

\begin{explanation}

The natural domain of a rational function is all real numbers except the zeros of the denominator. \\

The zeros of the denominator of $G$ are $-4$ and $2$. \\


The domain of $G$ is 

\[
\left( -\infty, \answer{-4} \right) \cup \left(\answer{-4}, \answer{2} \right) \cup \left( \answer{2}, \infty \right)
\]


\end{explanation}









\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{Zeros}} 

\begin{explanation}

The zeros of a rational function are the zeros of the numerator, which are not also zeros of the denominator.


Here, $-7$, $-5$, and $2$ are zeros of the numerator.  However, $2$ is not in the domain, becasue it is also a zero of the denominator.


The zeros of $G$ are $-7$ and $-5$.


\end{explanation}







\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{Continuity}} 

\begin{explanation}

Rational functions are continuous functions.

That means they are continuous on their domains. They have no discontiuities.

But, they might have singularities.  $G$ has singularities. $-4$ and $2$ are singulatities of $G$.


$2$ is a common zero of the numerator and denominator and can be removed to simplify the fraction


\[
G(t) = \frac{(t+7)(t+5)(t-2)}{(t+4)^2(t-2)} = \frac{(t+7)(t+5)}{(t+4)^2}
\]

That makes $2$ a removable singularity.


$G(2)$ has no value, but as $t$ approaches $2$, $G(t)$ approaches 


\[
\frac{(2+7)(2+5)}{(2+4)^2} = \frac{63}{36} = \frac{7}{4}
\]



Our way of saying this uses limit notation.



\[
\lim\limits_{t \to 2} G(t) = \frac{7}{4}
\]




$-4$ is a zero of the denominator but not the numerator.  That makes $-4$ an asymptotic singularity.  $G$ is unbounded near $-4$.  We just need to figure out what the sign is on either side of $-4$.


$-4$ is a singularity of even multiplicity.  So, $G$ does not change signs across $-4$.  The sign of $G$ is determined by $(t+7)(t+5)$.

\[
G(t) = \frac{(t+7)(t+5)}{(t+4)^2}
\]


$(t+7)(t+5)$ is a quadratic function witha positive leading coefficient. Therefore, $(t+7)(t+5)$ is positive on $(-5, \infty)$, which contains $-4$.

We can now describe the asymptotic behavior of $G$ around $-4$.


\[
\lim\limits_{t \to -4^-} G(t) = \infty
\]


\[
\lim\limits_{t \to -4^+} G(t) = \infty
\]

\end{explanation}



We have describe all of the behavior around the singularities. 

Now for end-behavior. 








\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{End-Behavior}} 

\begin{explanation}

$G$ is a rational function whose numerator and denominator have equal degrees, $3$.

The end-behavior is the quotient of the leading terms of the numerator and denominator.

\[
\lim\limits_{t \to -\infty} G(t) = \frac{1}{1} = 1
\]


\[
\lim\limits_{t \to \infty} G(t) = \frac{1}{1} = 1
\]

\end{explanation}























\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{Behavior (Increasing and Decreasing)}} 

\begin{explanation}



The domain of $G$ has three maximal intervals: $(-\infty,-4)$, $(-4,2)$, and $(2,\infty)$.  $G$ is continuous on each of these pieces.



Continuity tells us nothing about increasing and decreasing.


Neither does the end-behavior. The graph of a function could oscillate up and down many times as it settles down out in the tails.


We know that $-4$ is an asymptotic singularity and $G$ is unbounded near $-4$.  However, it is possible that the graph could oscillate up and down many times as grows.


None of this happens in this case.  We can see that in the graph.  But, our algebra cannot see it.



The best we can do is approaximate from the graph.

It appears from the graph below that $G$ is decreasing on approximately $(\infty, -5.5)$, increasing on approximately $(-5.5, -4)$, and decreasing on approximately $(-4, \infty)$.

\textbf{Note:} We will see later that there is plenty of reasons not to totally believe our eyes when examining a graph.



\end{explanation}
















\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{Local Maxmimums and Minimums}} 

\begin{explanation}


Since we are unable to algebraically find intervals where $G$ is increasing and decreasing, we are also unable to get exact values of critical numbers or maximum and minimum values of $G$.


We are left to approximate from the graph.

It appears that $G$ has a local minimum value of approximately $-0.3$ and $-5.5$.


\end{explanation}












\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{Global Maxmimum and Minimum}} 

\begin{explanation}


$G$ does not have a global maximum, since 


\[
\lim\limits_{t \to -4^+} G(t) = \infty
\]



It appears that $G$ has a global minimum value of approximately $-0.3$ and $-5.5$.



\end{explanation}














\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{Range}} 

\begin{explanation}

$G$ has three connected pieces.  The range of $G$ is the union of the ranges on those two pieces. 



We have seen that $G$ is unbounded positively near $-4$.  

Although we cannot verify algebraically, we think $G$ has a global minimum of approximately $-0.3$.


That would give a range of $[-0.3, \infty)$.



\end{explanation}















\subsection*{Graphical Analysis}


\begin{explanation}



The domain is $\left( -\infty, \answer{-4} \right) \cup \left(\answer{-4}, \answer{2} \right) \cup \left( \answer{2}, \infty \right)$.

Let's simplify: $G(t) = \frac{(t+7)(t+5)}{(t+4)^2}$, since $t-2$ is a common factor, since $-4$ and $2$ make the denominator $0$.



The $t-2$ factor is gone in our simplified formula, but $2$ is still not in the domain.  This will visually show up as a hole in the graph.



\begin{itemize}
\item $-7$ is a root of multiplicity $\answer{1}$.  Since this multiplicity is odd, $G$ will change sign through $\answer{-7}$ and the graph will cross at $(-7,0)$.
\item $-5$ is a root of multiplicity $\answer{1}$.  Since this multiplicity is odd, $G$ will change sign through $-5$ and the graph will cross at $(-5,0)$.
\item $-4$ is a singularity of multiplicity $\answer{2}$.  The function is unbounded near $-4$.  This will show up as a vertical asymptote on the graph. Since this multiplicity is even, $G$ will not change sign across $-4$.  The graph will approach the vertical asymptote similarly on both sides.
\item Our simplified version does not have the $t-2$ factor.  Therefore, the graph will not have an intercept nor a vertical asymptote associated with this factor.  It will have a hole at $\left( 2, \answer{\frac{63}{36}} \right)$.
\end{itemize}


The end-behavior of $G$ is $\frac{t^2}{t^2}$.  Therefore, $\lim\limits_{t \to -\infty}G(t) = 1$ and $\lim\limits_{t \to \infty}G(t) = 1$.  The graph has a horizontal asymptote.




Thinking left to right on the number line, $G$ starts off near $1$, which is positive.  It changes signs across $-7$ and becomes negative. It changes signs across $-5$ and becomes positive.  It cannot change sign until $-4$.  Therefore, $G$ becomes positively unbounded on the left side of $-4$.  Across $-4$, $G$ does not change sign.  Therefore, it is again unbounded and positive on the right side of the vertical asymptote.  There are no more zeros or singularities.  So, $G$ cannot change sign again.  Now, it approaches $1$ from above.

The graph is very suggestive that there is a local minimum somewhere around $-5.5$.

With some technology, we can approximate the critical number to be $-5.5$ and the local minimum to be $-0.333$, which agrees with our analysis.




The graph agrees with our analysis.
