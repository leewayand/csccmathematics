We are building a library of Elementary Functions.

We will use our library of functions quite often as our reason for conclusions within our analysis.

We have our first two library entries.











\begin{formula} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Linear Functions}} \\
\textbf{Linear functions} are functions which \textbf{\textcolor{red!70!black}{CAN}} be described with a formula of the form

\[  L(t) = a \, t + b   \]

where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.



\begin{itemize}
\item $a$ is called the \textbf{leading coefficient} 
\item $a \, t$ is called the \textbf{linear term} 
\item $b$ is called the \textbf{constant term} 
\end{itemize}



\end{formula}











\begin{formula} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Quadratic Functions}} \\
\textbf{Quadratic functions} are functions which \textbf{\textcolor{red!70!black}{CAN}} be described with a formula of the form

\[  Q(t) = a \, t^2 + b \, t + c  \]

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ (called \textbf{coefficients}) are real numbers with $a \ne 0$



\begin{itemize}
\item $a$ is called the \textbf{leading coefficient} 
\item $a \, t^2$ is called the \textbf{leading or quadratic term} 
\item $b \, t$ is called the \textbf{linear term} 
\item $c$ is called the \textbf{constant term} 
\end{itemize}


This is officially known as the \textbf{standard form}.

\end{formula}


These are our official library forms.



These are \textbf{\textcolor{red!70!black}{CAN}} questions.


If a formula \textbf{CAN} be written like $a \, t + b$, then the function is linear. 


If a formula \textbf{CAN} be written like $a \, t^2 + b \, t + c$, then the function is quadratic. 








\begin{example} Equivalent


$3(x-2) + 9$ is equivalent to $3x + 3$, so it is linear.




$\pi(7 - 5x) + 8x$ is equivalent to $(-5\pi + 8) x + 7\pi$, so it is linear.



$\frac{3+7x}{5}+2x$ is equivalent to $\frac{17}{5} x + \frac{3}{5}$, so it is linear.

\end{example}












\begin{example} Equivalent


$3(x-2)^2 + 9$ is equivalent to $3 x^2 - 12 x + 21$, so it is quadratic.




$2(x-1)(x+5)$ is equivalent to $2 x^2 + 8 x - 10$, so it is quadratic.




\end{example}
