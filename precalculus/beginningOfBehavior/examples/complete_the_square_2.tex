\begin{exercise} 


Complete the square to write $k^2 - 8k - 9$ in vertex form. \\



$k^2 - 8k - 9$ is in standard form, therefore



\begin{itemize}
\item  a = $\answer{1}$ \\
\item  b = $\answer{-8}$ \\
\item  c = $\answer{-9}$ \\
\end{itemize}



This makes $\frac{b}{2} = \answer{-4}$, and its square is $\left( \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 = \answer{16}$, which is added and subtracted to the expression.  That way we have only add $0$ to the expression and not changed any values. 


\[ k^2 - 8k + \answer{16} - \answer{16} + 11 \]



The ``added'' number is grouped together with the quadratic and linear terms to form a perfect square.



\[ \left( k - \answer{4} \right)^2  - 16 + 11 \]

And, we can combine the constant terms.



\[  ( k - 4 )^2  - 15  \]



\end{exercise}
