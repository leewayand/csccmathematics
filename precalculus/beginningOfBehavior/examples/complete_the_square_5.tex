\begin{exercise} 


Complete the square to write $3x^2 - 4x - 5$ in vertex form. \\



$3x^2 - 4x - 5$ is in standard form, therefore



\begin{itemize}
\item  a = $\answer{3}$ \\
\item  b = $\answer{-4}$ \\
\item  c = $\answer{-5}$ \\
\end{itemize}




$a \ne 1$, so let's factor it out of the quadratic and linear terms.



\[   3x^2 - 4x - 5 = 3 \left( x^2 - \frac{4}{3} x \right) - 5   \]




\begin{procedure} \textbf{Refocus:}  


Now, we are just focusing on the quadratic inside the parentheses.  It doesn't have a constant term.  The $-5$ will just float around outside the parentheses for a moment.



Our inside quadratic is $x^2 - \frac{4}{3} x$ or $x^2 - \frac{4}{3} x + 0$.


\begin{itemize}
\item  a = $\answer{1}$ \\
\item  b = $\answer{-\frac{4}{3}}$ \\
\item  c = $\answer{0}$ \\
\end{itemize}



This makes $\frac{b}{2} = \answer{-\frac{4}{6}}$, and its square is $\left( \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 = \answer{\frac{16}{36}}$, which is added and subtracted to the expression.  That way we have only add $0$ to the expression and not changed any values. 


\[ x^2 - \frac{4}{3} x + \answer{\frac{16}{36}} - \answer{\frac{16}{36}} \]



The ``added'' number is grouped together with the quadratic and linear terms to form a perfect square.



\[ \left( x^2 - \frac{4}{6} \right)^2  - \answer{\frac{16}{36}} \]



We might as well simplify our fractions.

\[ \left( x^2 - \frac{2}{3} \right)^2  - \answer{\frac{4}{9}} \]

\end{procedure}


That was happening inside the parentheses, so let's replace the old inside with the new inside.


\[ 3 \left(  \left( x^2 - \frac{2}{3} \right)^2  - \answer{\frac{4}{9}}   \right) - 5  \]




Distribute and combine the constant terms.



\[ 3 \left( x^2 - \frac{2}{3} \right)^2  - 3 \cdot \answer{\frac{4}{9}} - 5   \]



\[ 3 \left( x^2 - \frac{2}{3} \right)^2  - \answer{\frac{4}{3}} - 5   \]




\[ 3 \left( x^2 - \frac{2}{3} \right)^2  - \frac{19}{3}    \]






\end{exercise}
