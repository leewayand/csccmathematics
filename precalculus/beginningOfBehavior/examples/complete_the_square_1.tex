\begin{exercise} 


Complete the square to write $y^2 + 4y + 11$ in vertex form. \\



$y^2 + 4y + 11$ is in standard form, therefore



\begin{itemize}
\item  a = $\answer{1}$ \\
\item  b = $\answer{4}$ \\
\item  c = $\answer{11}$ \\
\end{itemize}



This makes $\frac{b}{2} = \answer{2}$, and its square is $\left( \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 = \answer{4}$, which is added and subtracted to the expression.  That way we have only add $0$ to the expression and not changed any values. 


\[ y^2 + 4y + \answer{4} - \answer{4} + 11 \]



The ``added'' number is grouped together with the quadratic and linear terms to form a perfect square.



\[ \left( y + \answer{2} \right)^2  - 4 + 11 \]

And, we can combine the constant terms.



\[  ( y + 2)^2  + 7 \]
