\begin{exercise} 


Complete the square to write $7 - T^2 - 6T$ in vertex form. \\



$7 - T^2 - 6T$ is not quite in standard form. Let's rearrange terms. $-T^2 - 6T + 7$ is in standard form, therefore



\begin{itemize}
\item  a = $\answer{-1}$ \\
\item  b = $\answer{-6}$ \\
\item  c = $\answer{7}$ \\
\end{itemize}




$a \ne 1$, so let's factor it out of the quadratic and linear terms.



\[   -T^2 - 6T + 7 = -(T^2 + 6T) + 7   \]




\begin{procedure} \textbf{Refocus:}  


Now, we are just focusing on the quadratic inside the parentheses.  It doesn't have a constant term.  The $7$ will just float around outside the parentheses for a moment.



Our inside quadratic is $T^2 + 6T$ or $T^2 + 6T + 0$.


\begin{itemize}
\item  a = $\answer{1}$ \\
\item  b = $\answer{6}$ \\
\item  c = $\answer{0}$ \\
\end{itemize}



This makes $\frac{b}{2} = \answer{3}$, and its square is $\left( \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 = \answer{9}$, which is added and subtracted to the expression.  That way we have only add $0$ to the expression and not changed any values. 


\[ T^2 + 6T + \answer{9} - \answer{9} \]



The ``added'' number is grouped together with the quadratic and linear terms to form a perfect square.



\[ ( T + \answer{3} )^2  - 9 \]





\end{procedure}


That was happening inside the parentheses, so let's replace the old inside with the new inside.


\[ -( ( T + 3 )^2  - 9 ) + 7 \]




Distribute and combine the constant terms.



\[ -( T + 3 )^2  + 9 + 7 \]


\[ -( T + 3 )^2  + 16  \]



\end{exercise}
