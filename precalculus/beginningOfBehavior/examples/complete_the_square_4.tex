\begin{exercise} 


Complete the square to write $5m^2 - 15m + 3$ in vertex form. \\



$5m^2 - 15m + 3$ is in standard form, therefore



\begin{itemize}
\item  a = $\answer{5}$ \\
\item  b = $\answer{-15}$ \\
\item  c = $\answer{3}$ \\
\end{itemize}




$a \ne 1$, so let's factor it out of the quadratic and linear terms.



\[   5m^2 - 15m + 3 = 5(m^2 - 3m) + 3   \]




\begin{procedure} \textbf{Refocus:}  


Now, we are just focusing on the quadratic inside the parentheses.  It doesn't have a constant term.  The $3$ will just float around outside the parentheses for a moment.



Our inside quadratic is $m^2 - 3m$ or $m^2 - 3m + 0$.


\begin{itemize}
\item  a = $\answer{1}$ \\
\item  b = $\answer{-3}$ \\
\item  c = $\answer{0}$ \\
\end{itemize}



This makes $\frac{b}{2} = \answer{-\frac{3}{2}}$, and its square is $\left( \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 = \answer{\frac{9}{4}}$, which is added and subtracted to the expression.  That way we have only add $0$ to the expression and not changed any values. 


\[ m^2 - 3m + \answer{\frac{9}{4}} - \answer{\frac{9}{4}} \]



The ``added'' number is grouped together with the quadratic and linear terms to form a perfect square.



\[ \left( m - \answer{\frac{3}{2}} \right)^2  - \frac{9}{4} \]





\end{procedure}


That was happening inside the parentheses, so let's replace the old inside with the new inside.


\[ 5 \left(  \left( m - \answer{\frac{3}{2}} \right)^2  - \frac{9}{4} \right) + 3 \]




Distribute and combine the constant terms.



\[ 5 \left( m - \frac{3}{2} \right)^2  - 5 \cdot \frac{9}{4}  + 3 \]



\[ 5 \left( m - \frac{3}{2} \right)^2  -   \frac{45}{4}  + 3 \]


\[ 5 \left( m - \frac{3}{2} \right)^2  -   \frac{\answer{33}}{4}  \]










\end{exercise}
