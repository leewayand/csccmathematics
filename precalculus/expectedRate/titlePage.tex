\maketitle



We have a well-known method for calculating a rate of change of a funciton over an interval.



The rate of change of $f$ over the interval $[a,b]$ is given by

\[
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}
\]



Obviously $a$ and $b$ need to be different numbers for this to work. Otherwsie, the rate would be $\frac{0}{0}$, which makes no sense.

We want to make some sense out of it.




\subsection*{Making Sense}

We will use limits to make sense out of 


\[
\frac{f(a) - f(a)}{a-a}
\]




Limits give us expected values. We can use limits to give us an expected value for $\frac{f(a) - f(a)}{a-a}$.



Our plan is to calculate $\frac{f(b) - f(c)}{b-c}$ for intervals continaing $a$, $a \in (b,c)$.

We'll let this interval shrink down closer and closer to $a$.

As the interval shrink, we'll watch the value of $\frac{f(b) - f(c)}{b-c}$.

From this we can determine an expected value.


We will call this value \textbf{the derivative of f at a : $f'(a)$}
