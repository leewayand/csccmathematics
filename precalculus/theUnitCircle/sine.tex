As we have seen, the sine function is just the $y$-coordinates of points on the unit circle viewed as a function of a central angle.



The coordinates of points on the Unit Circle are $( \cos(\theta), \sin(\theta) )$.

If we watch how the $y$-coordinates change as you travel counterclockwise around the unit circle, then we will see exactly how the sine function behaves.






\subsection*{Basic Sine Function}



The basic sine function is $\sin(\theta)$.

Its characteristics exactly follow the characteristics of the $y$-coordinates of points on the unit circle.






\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Domain}}

The domain of $\sin(\theta)$ is $(-\infty, \infty)$.



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Zeros}}


The zeros of $\sin(\theta)$ are the angles where the $y$-coordinates equal $0$.  These are teh angles which correspond to the points $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$.

That would be an infinite collection of angles.

\[
\{ \, k \pi \, \text{ | } \,  k \in \mathbb{Z} \,  \}
\]



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Continuity}}


$\sin(\theta)$ is a continuous function with no singularities.




\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{End-Behavior}}



Since sine is the $y$-coordinate of points on the unit circle, it just keeps oscillating between $-1$ and $1$.

$\sin(\theta)$ has no end-behavior other than oscillating.




\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Behavior}}


Following the $y$-coordinates for one cycle around the unit circle, we can see the behavior of $\sin(\theta)$.



\begin{itemize}
\item On $\left( 0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)$, $\sin(\theta)$ increases from $0$ to $1$.
\item On $\left( \frac{\pi}{2}, \pi \right)$, $\sin(\theta)$ decreases from $1$ to $0$.
\item On $\left( \pi, \frac{3\pi}{2} \right)$, $\sin(\theta)$ decreases from $0$ to $-1$.
\item On $\left( \frac{3\pi}{2}, 2\pi \right)$, $\sin(\theta)$ increases from $-1$ to $0$.
\end{itemize}


Since $\sin(\theta)$ is periodic with period $2\pi$, this behavior keeps repeating.





\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Global Maximum and Minimum}}



$\sin(\theta)$ is a continuous function and switches from increasing to decreasing at $\frac{\pi}{2}$.  


That makes $\sin\left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1$ the global maximum, which occurs at $\frac{\pi}{2}$.


Since $\sin(\theta)$ is periodic with period $2\pi$, this maximum keeps occurring.


The maximum value of $1$ occurs on the set 

\[
\{ \, \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k \pi \, \text{ | } \,  k \in \mathbb{Z} \,  \}
\]







$\sin(\theta)$ is a continuous function and switches from decreasing to increasing at $\frac{3\pi}{2}$.  


That makes $\sin\left( \frac{3\pi}{2} \right) = 1$ the global minimum, which occurs at $\frac{3\pi}{2}$.




Since $\sin(\theta)$ is periodic with period $2\pi$, this minimum keeps occurring.


The maximum value of $-1$ occurs on the set 

\[
\{ \, \frac{3\pi}{2} + 2k \pi \, \text{ | } \,  k \in \mathbb{Z} \,  \}
\]








\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Local Maximum and Minimum}}



The global extrema are automatically local extrema and they are the only ones, since there are no other critical numbers.







\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Range}}


$\sin(\theta)$ is a continuous function with a maximum of $1$ and a minimum of $-1$.

Therefore the range is $[-1,1]$.






\begin{idea}

The idea is that the basic sine function describes the $y$-coordinate as you travel counterclockwise around the unit circle.

The characteristics of the basic sine function hold steady during each quadrant, changing at the angles $0$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\pi$, $\frac{3\pi}{2}$, and $2\pi$. From there, they keep repeating.

This angle is whatever is inside the parentheses in $\sin(angle)$.


\end{idea}













\begin{example} Sine

Describe the behavior of   $f(x) = \sin\left( 2 x + \frac{\pi}{2} \right)$



\textbf{\textcolor{red!75!green}{explanation}} 



The ``angle'' is $2 x + \frac{\pi}{2}$.

We want to know when $2 x + \frac{\pi}{2}$ has the values $0$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\pi$, $\frac{3\pi}{2}$, and $2\pi$.






\[
\begin{array}{l|l}
\text{angle}                  & x  \\ \hline
2 x + \frac{\pi}{2} = 0        & x = -\frac{\pi}{4}  \\
2 x + \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{2}      &  x = 0 \\
2 x + \frac{\pi}{2} = \pi      & x = \frac{\pi}{4}  \\
2 x + \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{3\pi}{2}     & x = \frac{\pi}{2}   \\
2 x + \frac{\pi}{2} = 2\pi     & x = \frac{3\pi}{4}
\end{array}
\]


We now know which values of $x$ define our quadrants.





\[
\begin{array}{l|l}
\text{Quadrant}                  & x\text{-Interval}  \\  \hline
I        & x \in  \left( -\frac{\pi}{4}, 0 \right)  \\
II       & x \in  \left( 0, \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \\
III      & x \in  \left( \frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)  \\
IV       & x \in  \left( \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{4} \right)   \\
\end{array}
\]



Our principal interval is $\left( -\frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{3\pi}{4} \right)$.

That makes the period $\frac{3\pi}{4} - \left( -\frac{\pi}{4} \right) = \pi$.


Now we just remember what the basic sine function does in each quadrant. 



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Behavior}} 



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$ (I):}} On $\left( -\frac{\pi}{4}, 0 \right)$, $f(x)$ increases from $0$ to $1$.



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$ (II):}} On $\left( 0, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$, $f(x)$ decreases from $1$ to $0$.



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$ (III):}} On $\left( \frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)$, $f(x)$ decreases from $0$ to $-1$.


\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$ (IV):}} On $\left( \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{4} \right)$, $f(x)$ increases from $-1$ to $0$.



All of this repeats with a period of $\pi$.












\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$ desmos graph}} 
\begin{center}
\desmos{9gfp3dowoh}{400}{300}
\end{center}






\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Extrema}} 


On our principal interval, $f(x)$ has a global and local maximum of $1$ at $0$.


On our principal interval, $f(x)$ has a global and local minimum of $-1$ at $\frac{\pi}{2}$.




\end{example}




\begin{warning}


We must distinguish between the variable of the function and the angle of sine.


Our analysis follows the angle around the unit circle through the four quadrants.

\end{warning}

























\begin{example} Negative Leading Coefficient Inside

Describe the behavior of   $g(t) = \sin\left( \frac{\pi}{4} - 3 t \right)$



\textbf{\textcolor{red!75!green}{explanation}} 



The ``angle'' is $\frac{\pi}{4} - 3 t$.

We want to know when $\frac{\pi}{4} - 3 t$ has the values $0$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\pi$, $\frac{3\pi}{2}$, and $2\pi$.






\[
\begin{array}{l|l}
\text{angle}                  & t  \\ \hline
\frac{\pi}{4} - 3 t = 0        & t = \frac{\pi}{12}  \\
\frac{\pi}{4} - 3 t = \frac{\pi}{2}      &  t = -\frac{\pi}{12} \\
\frac{\pi}{4} - 3 t = \pi      & t = -\frac{\pi}{4}  \\
\frac{\pi}{4} - 3 t = \frac{3\pi}{2}     & t = -\frac{5\pi}{12}   \\
\frac{\pi}{4} - 3 t = 2\pi     & t = -\frac{7\pi}{12}
\end{array}
\]


We now know which values of $t$ define our quadrants, but they are running backwards.  

That is because of the negative coefficient in $-2 t$.


We just have to remember that we write interval notation as the numbers appear on the number line.  They are not written backwards.  

We write interval notation from left to right, but our angles are running backwards of that.  That reverses the behavior of $g(t)$.


The first quadrant begins at $\frac{\pi}{12}$ and ends at $-\frac{\pi}{12}$.

Therefore, our basic sine function is $0$ at $\frac{\pi}{12}$ and it is $1$ at $-\frac{\pi}{12}$.

But, we write our interval notation like  $\left( -\frac{\pi}{12}, \frac{\pi}{12} \right)$.

Our function will be $1$ on the left and $0$ on the right.  $g(t)$ will be decreasing.





\[
\begin{array}{l|l}
\text{Quadrant}                  & t\text{-Interval}  \\ \hline
I        & t \in  \left( -\frac{\pi}{12}, \frac{\pi}{12} \right)  \\
II       & t \in  \left( -\frac{\pi}{4}, -\frac{\pi}{12} \right) \\
III      & t \in  \left( -\frac{5\pi}{12}, -\frac{\pi}{4} \right)  \\
IV       & t \in  \left( -\frac{7\pi}{12}, -\frac{5\pi}{12} \right)   \\
\end{array}
\]



Our principal interval is $\left( -\frac{7\pi}{12}, \frac{\pi}{12} \right)$.

That makes the period $\frac{\pi}{12} - \left( -\frac{7\pi}{12} \right) = \frac{\pi}{12} -\frac{7\pi}{12} = \frac{8\pi}{12} = \frac{2\pi}{3}$.


Now we just remember what the basic sine function does in each quadrant. 

We just read it backwards.

The basic sine function values are 
\[
0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow -1 \rightarrow 0
\]


$g(t)$ odes the same thing.  It just does it from right to left:

\[
0 \leftarrow -1 \leftarrow 0 \leftarrow 1 \leftarrow 0
\]


But, we still read left to right.  So, $g(t)$ begins on the left at $0$, decreases to $-1$, increases to $0$, increases to $1$, then decreases to $0$.










\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Behavior}} 



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$ (I):}} On $\left( -\frac{\pi}{12}, \frac{\pi}{12} \right)$, $g(t)$ decreases from $0$ to $-1$.



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$ (II):}} On $\left( -\frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$, $g(t)$ increases from $-1$ to $0$.



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$(III):}} On $\left( -\frac{5\pi}{12}, -\frac{\pi}{4} \right)$, $g(t)$ increases from $0$ to $1$.


\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$(IV):}} On $\left( -\frac{7\pi}{12}, -\frac{5\pi}{12} \right)$, $g(t)$ decreases from $1$ to $0$.



All of this repeats with a period of $\frac{2\pi}{3}$.









\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$ desmos graph}} 
\begin{center}
\desmos{tjeuggk3k2}{400}{300}
\end{center}




We can reverse the order of our intervals to make it follow the graph better.

On $\left( -\frac{7\pi}{12}, -\frac{5\pi}{12} \right)$, $g(t)$ decreases.

On $\left( -\frac{5\pi}{12}, -\frac{\pi}{4} \right)$, $g(t)$ increases.

On $\left( -\frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$, $g(t)$ increases.

On $\left( -\frac{\pi}{12}, \frac{\pi}{12} \right)$, $g(t)$ decreases.








\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Extrema}} 


On our principal interval, $g(t)$ has a global and local maximum of $1$ at $-\frac{\pi}{12}$.


On our principal interval, $g(t)$ has a global and local minimum of $-1$ at $-\frac{5\pi}{12}$.




\end{example}


\textbf{\textcolor{red!70!black}{Note:}}  In the example above, the inside of the sine function is a linear function with a negative leading coefficent.  That has reversed the behavior from the basic sine function.

Reading the graph of the basic sine function from left, we see that the basic sine function increases, then decreases, then increases.


Reading the graph of the sine function in the example above, from left we see that the sine function decreases, then increases, then decreases.





\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$}} In addition to the leading coefficient of the inner linear function, the sine funciton itself has a leading coefficient.  When it is negative, the behavior reverses again.




This example has illustrated a fact about function behavior.



\begin{fact}

If $f(x)$ is increasing on $(a, b)$, then $f(-x)$ is decreasing on $(a, b)$.

\textbf{\textcolor{red!75!green}{explanation}} 

$f(x)$ is increasing on $(a, b)$ means that for any $x$ and $y$ in $(a, b)$ with $x < y$, it must be true that $f(x) < f(y)$.


We want to show that $f(-x)$ is decreasing on $(a, b)$.  Let's call $f(-x)$ by a new name.  $g(x) = f(-x)$

We want to show that $g(x)$ is decreasing.

We want to show that that for any $x$ and $y$ in $(a, b)$ with $x < y$, it must be true that $g(x) > g(y)$.



So, let's pretend we have $x$ and $y$ in $(a, b)$ with $x < y$.

Then $-x > -y$.

Then $f(-x) > f(-y)$, because $f$ is increasing.

But, that is the same as $g(x) > g(y)$.

Than means that $g$ is decreasing.



\end{fact}





























\begin{example} Negative Leading Coefficient

Describe the behavior of   $H(k) = -2 \sin\left( \frac{k}{3} - \pi \right)$



\textbf{\textcolor{red!75!green}{explanation}} 



\textbf{Step 1)}  We'll take this in two steps.  First, the inside.  Then, the outside.


First, we'll just think of $\sin\left( \frac{k}{3} - \pi \right)$.  Then, we'll bring in the $-2$.



The ``angle'' is $\frac{k}{3} - \pi$.

We want to know when $\frac{k}{3} - \pi$ has the values $0$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\pi$, $\frac{3\pi}{2}$, and $2\pi$.






\[
\begin{array}{l|l}
\text{angle}                  & k  \\ \hline
\frac{k}{3} - \pi = 0        & k = 3 \pi  \\
\frac{k}{3} - \pi = \frac{\pi}{2}      &  k = \frac{9\pi}{2} \\
\frac{k}{3} - \pi = \pi      & k = 6 \pi  \\
\frac{k}{3} - \pi = \frac{3\pi}{2}     & k = \frac{15\pi}{2}   \\
\frac{k}{3} - \pi = 2\pi     & k = 9 \pi
\end{array}
\]


We now know which values of $k$ define our quadrants.





\[
\begin{array}{l|l}
\text{Quadrant}                  & k\text{-Interval}  \\  \hline
I        & k \in  \left( 3\pi, \frac{9\pi}{2} \right)  \\
II       & k \in  \left( \frac{9\pi}{2}, 6 \pi \right) \\
III      & k \in  \left( 6 \pi, \frac{15\pi}{2} \right)  \\
IV       & k \in  \left( \frac{15\pi}{2}, 9 \pi \right)   \\
\end{array}
\]



Our principal interval is $\left( 3 \pi, 9 \pi \right)$.

That makes the period $9 \pi - 3 \pi = 6 \pi$.


Now we just remember what the basic sine function does in each quadrant. 



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Behavior}} 



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$ (I):}} On $\left( 3 \pi, \frac{9\pi}{2} \right)$, $f(x)$ increases from $0$ to $1$.



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$ (II):}} On $\left( \frac{9\pi}{2}, 6 \pi \right)$, $f(x)$ decreases from $1$ to $0$.



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$ (III):}} On $\left( 6 \pi, \frac{15\pi}{2} \right)$, $f(x)$ decreases from $0$ to $-1$.


\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$ (IV):}} On $\left( \frac{15\pi}{2}, 9 \pi \right)$, $f(x)$ increases from $-1$ to $0$.



All of this repeats with a period of $6 \pi$.






\textbf{Step 2)}



Now we'll bring in $-2$ as the leading coefficent.


We need another fact about function behavior.




\begin{fact}

If $f(x)$ is increasing on $(a, b)$, then $-f(x)$ is decreasing on $(a, b)$.

\textbf{\textcolor{red!75!green}{explanation}} 

$f(x)$ is increasing on $(a, b)$ means that for any $x$ and $y$ in $(a, b)$ with $x < y$, it must be true that $f(x) < f(y)$.


We want to show that $-f(x)$ is decreasing on $(a, b)$.  Let's call $-f(x)$ by a new name.  $g(x) = -f(x)$

We want to show that $g(x)$ is decreasing.

We want to show that that for any $x$ and $y$ in $(a, b)$ with $x < y$, it must be true that $g(x) > g(y)$.



So, let's pretend we have $x$ and $y$ in $(a, b)$ with $x < y$.

Then $f(x) < f(y)$, because $f$ is increasing.

Then $-f(x) > -f(y)$.

But, that is the same as $g(x) > g(y)$.

Than means that $g$ is decreasing.



\end{fact}




The negative leading coefficient reverses all of the behavior.










\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Behavior of $H(k)$}} 



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$}} On $\left( 3 \pi, \frac{9\pi}{2} \right)$, $f(x)$ decreases from $0$ to $2$.



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$}} On $\left( \frac{9\pi}{2}, 6 \pi \right)$, $f(x)$ increases from $2$ to $0$.



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$}} On $\left( 6 \pi, \frac{15\pi}{2} \right)$, $f(x)$ increases from $0$ to $-2$.


\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$}} On $\left( \frac{15\pi}{2}, 9 \pi \right)$, $f(x)$ decreases from $-2$ to $0$.



All of this repeats with a period of $6 \pi$.









\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$\blacktriangleright$ desmos graph}} 
\begin{center}
\desmos{xljum2jpck}{400}{300}
\end{center}






\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Extrema}} 




$\sin\left( \frac{k}{3} - \pi \right)$ has a maximum value of $1$ and a minimum value of $-2$.

$-2 \sin\left( \frac{k}{3} - \pi \right) + 1$ has a maximum value of $3$ and a minimum value of $-2$.





On our principal interval, $H(k)$ has a global and local maximum of $2$ at $\frac{15\pi}{2}$.  This is where the function switches from increasing to decreasing.


On our principal interval, $H(k)$ has a global and local maximum of $-2$ at $\frac{9\pi}{2}$.  This is where the function switches from decreasing to increasing.
