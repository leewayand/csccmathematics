Premixed concrete has a base price for each cubic yard of concrete purchased.


At Charlie's Concrete the base price is $\$133$ per cubic yard of concrete.




\begin{exercise}

$15$ cubic yards of premixed concrete cost $\$\answer{1995}$. \\

$98$ cubic yards of premixed concrete cost $\$\answer{13034}$. \\

\end{exercise}



Actually, the base price at Charlie's depends on how much concrete you are purchasing. \\


The base price is $\$133$ per cubic yard of concrete, provided you are purchasing $10$ or more cubic yards of concrete.  If you are purchasing less than $10$ cubic yards, then the base price goes up.

The base price increases by $\$53$ for every cubic yard below $10$ that you are purchasing. 







\begin{exercise}

If you are purchasing $9$ cubic yards of premixed concrete, then the base price is $\$\answer{186}$. \\

If you are purchasing $9$ cubic yards of premixed concrete, then the total purchase price is $\$\answer{1674}$. \\

\end{exercise}







\begin{exercise}

If you are purchasing $5$ cubic yards of premixed concrete, then the base price is $\$\answer{398}$. \\

If you are purchasing $5$ cubic yards of premixed concrete, then the total purchase price is $\$\answer{1990}$. \\

\end{exercise}







\begin{exercise}

If you are purchasing $3.5$ cubic yards of premixed concrete, then the base price is $\$\answer{477.50}$ (round to the nearest cent). \\

If you are purchasing $3.5$ cubic yards of premixed concrete, then the total purchase price is $\$\answer{1671.25}$ (round to the nearest cent). \\

\end{exercise}






Charlie's has some purchasing rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item Charlie's can measure cubic yards down to thousandths of a cubic yard. 
\item Charlie's rounds all base prices to the nearest cent.
\item Charlie's also rounds all total purchasing bills to the nearest dollar.
\end{itemize}






\begin{exercise}

If you are purchasing $13.533$ cubic yards of premixed concrete, then the base price is $\$\answer{133}$ (round to the nearest cent). \\

If you are purchasing $13.533$ cubic yards of premixed concrete, then the total purchase price is $\$\answer{1800}$ (round to the nearest dollar). \\



If you are purchasing $3.983$ cubic yards of premixed concrete, then the base price is $\$\answer{451.90}$ (round to the nearest cent). \\

If you are purchasing $3.983$ cubic yards of premixed concrete, then the total purchase price is $\$\answer{1800}$ (round to the nearest dollar). \\



If you are purchasing $8.526$ cubic yards of premixed concrete, then the base price is $\$\answer{133}$ (round to the nearest cent). \\

If you are purchasing $8.526$ cubic yards of premixed concrete, then the total purchase price is $\$\answer{1800}$ (round to the nearest dollar). \\

\begin{exercise} Function

Define the \textit{Charlie} function by pairs of the form $(c, d)$, where $c$ is cubic yards to the thousandths and $d$ is the final dollar cost.  Domain is the interval $[0, 1,000,000]$ (to thousandths). The Codomain is the interval $(0, \infty)$.

According to the previous exercise three of the pairs would be

\begin{itemize}
\item $\left( 13.533, \answer{1800} \right)$
\item $\left( 3.983, \answer{1800} \right)$
\item $\left( 8.526, \answer{1800} \right)$
\end{itemize}


Does this violate the function rule?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice {Yes}
\choice [correct]{No}
\end{multipleChoice}




If you purchase some cubic yards of concrete, is it possible for that to have two different costs?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice {Yes}
\choice [correct]{No}
\end{multipleChoice}









Is \textit{Charlie} a function?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice [correct]{Yes}
\choice {No}
