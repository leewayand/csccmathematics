\subsection*{Composition}


Composition is an operation on functions.  It takes two functions and produces a third function.


\[  (Outside \circ Inside)(d) = Outside(Inside(d))    \]


We will examine composition in more detail throughout the course, but right now we are emphasizing composition with linear functions.



For our transformation story, we begin with a function, $f(x)$.


We can compose with a linear function in two ways:



\[
f(linear)
\] 


\[
linear(f)
\]


How does each of these affect $f(x)$?


\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Inside:}} $f(a \, x + b)$  


We can view this as a composition:


\[  \text{Let } \, L(t) = a \, t + b   \]


\[   f(a \, x + b)  = (f \circ L)(x)\]



This affects the domain of $f$, which is illustrated as horizontal graphical transformations.





\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Outside:}} $a \, f(x) + b$  


We can view this as a composition:


\[  \text{Let } \, L(t) = a \, t + b   \]


\[   a \, f(x) + b  = (L \circ f)(x)\]


This affects the range of $f$, which is illustrated as vertical graphical transformations.
