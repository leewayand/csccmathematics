Direction vectors or unit vectors are vectors of length $1$, which makes the unit circle the key to understanding the Complex Numbers. \\ 



We can describe every complex number by providing a complex number on the unit circle to give the direction and then a distance to move in that direction.  \\ 

We have already described points on the unit circle with sine and cosine: $(cos(\theta), sin(\theta))$. 

Therefore, we have already described complex numbers on the unit circle with sine and cosine: $cos(\theta) + sin(\theta) \, i$.  


All of this came from investigating the right triangle formed from points on the unit circle. \\
