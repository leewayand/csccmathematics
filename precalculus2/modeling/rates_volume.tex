We can also measure volume and how it changes.



\[
\text{rate} = \frac{\Delta \text{volume}}{\Delta \text{time}} 
\]








\subsection*{Conical Tank}

A conical tank (with vertex down) is 12 feet across and 14 fee deep. If water is flowing into the tank at a rate of 9 cubic feet per minute, find the rate of change of the depth of the water when the water is 8 feet deep.

$\blacktriangleright$ We begin with two pertinent lengths that remain constant throughout the story:

\begin{itemize}
\item $R$ is the radius of the base of the conical tank.
\item $H$ is the height of the conical tank.
\end{itemize}

These are constant functions of time, $t$: $R(t)$ and $H(t)$.







\begin{question} 


As water pours into the tank, what shape does the water take?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice {Triangle}
\choice {Sphere}
\choice[correct] {Cone}
\choice {Rectangular Prism}
\end{multipleChoice}

\end{question}









\begin{question} 


As water pours into the tank, how does the height of the water change?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct] {Increases}
\choice {Decreases}
\choice {Remains Constant}
\end{multipleChoice}

\end{question}







\begin{question} 


As water pours into the tank, how does the radius of the water base change?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct] {Increases}
\choice {Decreases}
\choice {Remains Constant}
\end{multipleChoice}

\end{question}









\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{Step 3: Water Measurements}}


As water pours into the tank the water level rises.  The water also forms a cone and the height and radius both increase.

$\blacktriangleright$ We need to represent these measurements as well:

\begin{itemize}
\item $r$ is the radius of the base of the conical water.
\item $h$ is the height of the conical water.
\end{itemize}

These are increasing functions of time, $t$: $r(t)$ and $h(t)$.










\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{Step 4: Geometric Relationships}}


Our measurements are vertical and horizontal measurements.  If we look at these from the side of the tank, they make a right triangle.  In fact, they make two similar right triangles.

$\blacktriangleright$ Similar Triangles



\[
\frac{H}{R} = \frac{h}{r}
\]


From this relationship, we can get expressions for $h$ or $r$ in terms of the others. 



\[
h = \frac{r \, H}{R} \, \text{ and } \,  r = \frac{h \, R}{H}
\]







$\blacktriangleright$ Volume


We are also given information about the volume.  Therefore, we should be thinking about the volume of cones.

\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi \, r^2 \, h
\]







We are just modeling here, which means collecting as many descriptions and relationships as we can. \\




We can make a model for the volume of the water in terms of $h$:

\[  V(h) = \frac{1}{3}  \pi \, \left( \frac{h \, R}{H} \right)^2 \, h    \]



We can make a model for the volume of the water in terms of $r$:

\[  V(r) = \frac{1}{3}  \pi \, r^2 \, \frac{r \, H}{R}    \]





With these models we can consider the original question.  We'll leave this for later.
