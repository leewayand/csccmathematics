What do we want when analyzing a function?


\begin{itemize}
\item domain and range
\item zeros 
\item dicsontinuities and singularities
\item intervals of continuity
\item critical numbers
\item intervals where increasing and decreasing
\item global maximum and minimium
\item local maximums and minimums
\item end-behavior
\item limiting behavior
\end{itemize}

In addition, we want \textbf{\textcolor{red!80!black}{algebraic}} and functional reasoning on how we arrive at our conclusions.


To help us with this goal of algebraic communication, we can use a nice graph.  Everything we eventually want to say algebraically corresponds to graphical characteristics.

We don't want our reasoning to be ``look at the graph'', however, we can look at the graph and have it help us translate our reasoning into algebra and function language.





Along with dots representing function pairs, a nice graph, including auxillary graphing items
\begin{itemize}
	\item intercepts
	\item endpoints
	\item vertical asymptotes
	\item horizontal asymptotes
\end{itemize}





A graph is a communication tool.
