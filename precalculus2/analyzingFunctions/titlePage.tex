What do we want when analyzing a function?



\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textcolor{red!80!black}{Domain}} 
\item \textbf{\textcolor{red!80!black}{Zeros}} 
\item \textbf{\textcolor{red!80!black}{Continuity}} 
	\begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{discontinuities}} 
     \item \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{singularities}} 
	\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textcolor{red!80!black}{End-Behavior}} 
\item \textbf{\textcolor{red!80!black}{Behavior}} 
	\begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{intervals where increasing}} 
     \item \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{intervals where decreasing}} 
	\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textcolor{red!80!black}{Global Maximum and Minimum}} 
\item \textbf{\textcolor{red!80!black}{Local Maximums and Minimums}} 
\item \textbf{\textcolor{red!80!black}{Range}} 
\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{...and we would like a nice graph}} 
\end{itemize}







We want a nice, informative graph
\begin{itemize}
	\item labeled axes
	\item intercepts
	\item endpoints
	\item vertical asymptotes
	\item horizontal asymptotes
	\item arrows
\end{itemize}


A graph is simply a communication tool.  It is inherently inaccurate by the very fact that it is drawn.  Algebra and functional reasoning are the only tools for exactness, which is our end goal. \\



$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{\textcolor{red!70!black}{Reasoning:}} Reasoning is a logical explanation that describes our conclusions, how we arrived at those conclusions, and why we think those conclusions are correct. \\

Analysis is not a list of conclusions. We are not looking for such a list. \\

We are certainly not looking for such a list based on viewing a graph. \\

We are looking for the thought process that arrived at the list of conclusions. \\
