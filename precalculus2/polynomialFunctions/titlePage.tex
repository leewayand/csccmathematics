Polynomial functions are our ``go to'' functions.  They are like decimal numbers for functions.  

When you need to approximate a number, you select a decimal expansion with enough digits to give you the accuracy you desire. When you need to approximate a function, you select a polynomial with enough terms to give you the accuracy you desire. 

We will do plenty of this approximating in Calculus.

So, we want to know everything about polynomials.
