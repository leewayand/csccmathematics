\maketitle




Precalculus is largely about the structure of the Elementary Functions and how we reason about them.  This includes power functions; radical and root functions; linear, quadratic, and other polynomial functions; rational functions; exponential functions; logarithmic functions; and a library of trigonometric functions (which are introduced in this course).

As a segue from the first half of Precalculus, let's quickly review our growing library of Elementary Functions. We'll begin with the exponential functions.   \\





$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Basic Exponential Functions}} 


The template for the basic exponential function looks like \textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$exp(x) = a \cdot r^x$}}. 

\begin{itemize}
\item $a$ is the \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{leading coefficient}}.  It primarily determines the sign of the function values.
\item $r$ is the \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{base}}. It determines how the function values grow, depending on whether $0 < r < 1$ or $1 < r$.
\end{itemize}





$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Shifted Exponential Functions}}   

The template for a shifted exponential function looks like \textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$exp(x) = a \cdot r^{b \, x + c} + d$}}  or just \textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{$a \cdot r^x + d$}}. 

\begin{itemize}
\item $b$ and $c$ describe a \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{shift}} in the domain from the basic exponential function.  
\item $d$ describes a \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{shift}} in the function value from the basic exponential function. 
\end{itemize}

The first terms in our shifted exponential function is still an exponential function:

\[
a \cdot r^{b \, x + c} = a \cdot r^{b \, x} \cdot  r^c = (a \cdot r^c) \cdot r^{b \, x} = (a \cdot r^c) \cdot (r^b)^x 
\]

It CAN be written in the form $A \cdot R^x$.


However, the second term, the ``+ d'' cannot be absorbed into the exponential form.  However, shifting functions is a very common operation and so, we'll include $a \cdot r^{b \, x + c} + d$ in our general ideas of exponential functions.
