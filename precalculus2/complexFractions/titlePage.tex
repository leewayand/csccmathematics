\maketitle







We now have a new number system called the \textbf{Complex Numbers}.  The Complex Numbers include the real numbers and we have defined arithmetic operations that extend the arithmetic of the real numbers.  So, arithmetic works like we think it should work.

We have a full arithmetic of complex numbers: complex addition, complex subtraction, complex multiplication, and complex division.



Complex division will be defined through reciprocals and complex fractions.  We need a complex fraction like

\[  \frac{a \, + \, b \, i}{c \, + \, d \, i}     \]


To look like

\[  A \, + B \, i    \]

$A$ and $B$ might be fractions, but they are real numbers. \\
