$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{\textcolor{red!80!black}{Reasoning:}} Reasoning is a logical explanation that describes our conclusions, how we arrived at those conclusions, and why we think those conclusions are correct. \\

Analysis is not a list of conclusions. We are not looking for such a list. \\

We are looking for the thought process that arrived at the list of conclusions. \\




\begin{example}


\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{Completely analyze $p(k) = k \sqrt{4-k^2}$}}






$\blacktriangleright$  \textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Domain:}} 

We need the inside of the square root to be nonnegative (positive or zero).  So, we need $k^2 \leq 4$. Which leaves us with a natural domain of $[-2, 2]$.





$\blacktriangleright$  \textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Continuity:}} 

Both $k$ and $\sqrt{4 - k^2}$ are continuous, since they are a polynomial and a square root of a polynomial.  $p$ is the product of continuous functions, so it is continuous.



$\blacktriangleright$  \textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Zeros:}} 


\[  p(k) = 0   \]

\[  k \sqrt{4-k^2} = 0  \]


By the Zero Product Property, we have that either $k = 0$ or $\sqrt{4-k^2} = 0$.


Zeros are $-2$, $0$, and $2$. \\




$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Behavior:}}  





Since $\sqrt{k^2 - 4} \geq 0$, the sign of $p(k)$ is the same as the sign of $\answer{k}$.

\begin{itemize}
\item  $p(k)$ \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{$<$} \choice{$>$}}  $0$ on $(-2, 0)$.
\item  $p(k)$ \wordChoice{\choice{$<$} \choice[correct]{$>$}}  $0$ on $(0, 2)$.
\end{itemize}


Since $p$ is continuous, we must have 


\begin{itemize}
\item  $p(-2) = 0$.
\item  We have $p(-2)=0$ and $p(k)<0$ on $(-2,0)$, therefore, $p(k)$ begins \wordChoice{\choice{increasing} \choice[correct]{decreasing}}  at $-2$.
\item  $p(k)$ eventually \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{increases} \choice{decreases}}  back to $p(0) = 0$.
\item  $p(k)$ continues \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{increasing} \choice{decreasing}}  beyond $p(0) = 0$.
\item  $p(k)$ eventually \wordChoice{\choice{increases} \choice[correct]{decreases}}  back to $p(2) = 0$.
\end{itemize}


There must be at least two critical numbers.  One inside $\left( \answer{-2}, \answer{0} \right)$ and one inside $\left( \answer{0}, \answer{2} \right)$.

            \addplot [line width=2, penColor, smooth,samples=100,domain=(-2:2)] {x * sqrt(4 - x^2)};


            \addplot[color=penColor,fill=penColor,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(-2,0) (0,0) (2,0)}; 





           

  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}










$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Extrema:}}  


With a little help from DESMOS, we can \textbf{approximate} the critical numbers as $-1.414$ and $1.414$.



\begin{itemize}
\item  $p(k)$ decreasing on $[-2, -1.414]$.
\item  $p(k)$ increases on $[-1.414, 1.414]$.
\item  $p(k)$ decreases on $[1.414, 2]$.
\end{itemize}




$p(-1.414)$ is the approximate global (and local) minimum. \\

$p(1.414)$ is the approximate global (and local) maximum. \\



And this is the problem we face in Precalculus. We don't seem to have enough algebra tools to locate local minimums and maximums. Sometimes we can, depending on the formula, but mostly we cannot. We turn to graphs for help knowing that they might be hiding important information.\\



\end{example}













\section*{with Calculus}


Calculus will give us a formula for the derivative.

\[    p'(k) = \sqrt{4 - k^2} + k \cdot \frac{-2k}{\sqrt{4-k^2}}  \]


This derivative has zeros of $-\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{2}$, which are approximately $-1.414$ and $1.4141$.
